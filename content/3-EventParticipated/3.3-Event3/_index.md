# Event 3: Secure Hybrid Access to S3 using VPC Endpoints

### Event Information

- **Event Name:** Secure Hybrid Access to S3 using VPC Endpoints
- **Date & Time:** 9:00a.m 4th April
- **Location:** Academy Hall FPT university
- **Role:** Attendee

---

## Event Description

This workshop focused on how to securely access Amazon S3 from different environments (cloud and on-premises) using VPC Endpoints.

The session introduced how modern cloud architectures can avoid exposing traffic to the public internet while still maintaining efficient and secure communication between services.

---

## Main Content

### 1. Overview of Private Connectivity

The workshop introduced **AWS PrivateLink**, which enables private communication between VPCs and AWS services without using the public internet.

Key idea:

- Keep traffic inside AWS network
- Improve security and reduce exposure risks
- Ensure stable and low-latency connections

---

### 2. Types of VPC Endpoints

Two main types were presented:

#### Gateway Endpoint

- Used for **Amazon S3 and DynamoDB**
- Route traffic via **route tables**
- No need for public IP

#### Interface Endpoint

- Uses **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)**
- Supports more AWS services
- Uses **DNS resolution**
- Works well for hybrid/on-premises systems

---

### 3. Access S3 from VPC

Steps demonstrated:

- Create a **Gateway Endpoint**
- Configure route tables
- Test connection from EC2 to S3

Result:

- EC2 can access S3 privately
- No internet gateway required

---

### 4. Access S3 from On-Premises

The workshop also simulated hybrid architecture:

- On-premises system connects to AWS via VPC
- Use **Interface Endpoint**
- Configure DNS for service resolution

This allows secure access from external systems into AWS services.

---

### 5. VPC Endpoint Policies

- Control access at a fine-grained level
- Restrict which resources can be accessed
- Improve security by applying least privilege principle

---

## Key Takeaways

From this workshop, I learned that:

- VPC Endpoints are essential for secure cloud architecture
- It is possible to access AWS services without using the public internet
- Gateway and Interface endpoints serve different use cases
- Hybrid architectures require proper DNS and networking setup
- Security can be enhanced using endpoint policies

---

## Personal Experience

This workshop helped me better understand how networking works in AWS, especially in secure and enterprise environments.

I found it very useful because it relates directly to real-world systems where security and data privacy are critical.

The knowledge gained is highly applicable to my current project, especially when working with AWS services like S3 and designing a secure architecture.

---

## Conclusion

This event provided practical knowledge on how to build secure and scalable architectures using VPC Endpoints.

It strengthened my understanding of AWS networking and gave me a clearer view of how to design systems that are both efficient and secure.
