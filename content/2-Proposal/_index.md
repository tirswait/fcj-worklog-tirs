### 1. Executive Summary

**GuardScript** is a script distribution platform with loader-based access control. Instead of distributing source code directly, the system serves script content through controlled endpoints with signature checks, timestamp/nonce validation, license enforcement, HWID binding, and workspace access policies.

The solution uses a serverless AWS architecture to reduce operational overhead, support scale, and satisfy cloud workshop objectives.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

#### Current Problems

The team identified three key issues in script delivery workflows:

1. Source code can be easily leaked or copied when shared manually
2. Lack of fine-grained access control for users or teams
3. Difficulty in tracking versions, access, and usage history
4. Absence of centralized management leading to fragmented data
5. Limited auditing, monitoring, and protection mechanisms
6. Deployment and security systems are often complex and costly
 
#### Solution

The proposed system addresses these issues through:

1. Loader-based script retrieval instead of direct source distribution.
2. Dual transfer protocols: v2 (XOR + response verification) and v3 (X25519 ECDH + AES-GCM).
3. License/HWID controls with access list policies.
4. Cloud-native observability using CloudWatch and application logs.

#### Benefits and ROI

1. Stronger control over script usage and distribution.
2. Better protection against API abuse via signed requests and rate limits.
3. Cost-efficient operation for student/demo workloads with pay-per-use services.

---

### 3. Solution Architecture

The architecture follows a serverless model with edge delivery for frontend and Lambda-based API processing.

**Typical request flow:**

```
Client (browser / loader)
  → CloudFront Distribution (SSL termination, cache layer)
    → Static assets: S3 bucket (frontend)
    → API /api/*, /files/*: Lambda Function URL origin
      → DynamoDB (users, workspaces, projects, licenses, logs, rate_limits, ...)
      → S3 (script/content objects)
  → API Gateway WebSocket (real-time updates)
  → CloudWatch Logs / Alarms / Dashboard
```

### 7. Risk Assessment

| Risk                      | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                             |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Lambda cold start latency | Medium | Medium      | Optimize handlers and monitor p95      |
| DynamoDB throttling       | High   | Low         | On-demand scaling, CloudWatch alerts   |
| S3 PUT/GET failures       | High   | Low         | Retry logic, versioning enabled        |
| Budget overrun            | Medium | Low         | AWS Budgets alerts, optimize TTL/cache |
| Replay attacks            | High   | Low         | Timestamp + nonce + HMAC required      |

**Contingency Plan:**

* If primary endpoint behavior fails → fallback to Lambda Function URL.
* If S3 is unavailable → retry with exponential backoff, log to CloudWatch.
* Use SAM/CloudFormation stacks for quick infrastructure recovery.

---

### 8. Expected Outcomes

**Technical Outcomes:**

* End-to-end AWS serverless deployment with validated API and loader flow.
* Dual loader protocol support with security controls (signature, HWID, rate-limit).
* Baseline observability for runtime health and performance.
* Reproducible deployment process aligned with workshop requirements.

**Long-term Value:**

* Extendable architecture for additional loaders and governance features.
* Reusable cloud-native reference for future FCJ workshop projects.

### 9. Future Improvements

1. Add production-ready SES email workflow for invitations.
2. Add AWS WAF managed rules for edge protection.
3. Upgrade S3 encryption controls from SSE-S3 to SSE-KMS CMK where needed.
4. Add AWS Budgets and Cost Anomaly Detection.
5. Increase automated test coverage (unit/integration/security checks).
